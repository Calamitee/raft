Monday or Tuesday, week 1: Design planning:
Atendees: Product Manager, Tech Lead, Frontend Dev, Design Lead, UX Researcher, Content Strategist. 
Goals: begin conversations regarding the most appropriate design solutions for the appp. The team will likely come up with several possibilities and they will spend the rest ot he week exploring / researching that and determining the best one.

The rest of the week should be spent determinig the right 'scaffolding' for the progect; this includes the arcitechture (from the architecture planning team) and wire frames (from the design planning team) for the project. During the time the teams should meet independantly as neccesary, and the product manager should check with each team member daily to ensure focus is maintained and any potential issues are identified as soon as possible. A daily stand up could be useful but I wouldn't implement that until the start fo the first formal sprint.  This work will also give the team a better idea of whether the timeline and budget is appropriate. If the existing budget and timeline is insufficient, it should be revealed as early as possible so that either the timeline / budget can be expanded or the scope can be reduced.

Week 1 output: first draft roadmap, architechture, & user flows should be complete.

Monday, week 2: Internal status meeting
Atendees: entire internal team
Goals: socialize the plan for back end and front end implementation, walk through arcitechture and user flows, address any questions or concerns.

Monday, week 2: client status meeting
